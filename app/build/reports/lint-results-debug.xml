        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html as well as follow this guide:&#xA;https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html"

        explanation="Calling `mutableStateOf&lt;T>()` when `T` is either backed by a primitive type on the JVM or is a value class results in a state implementation that requires all state values to be boxed. This usually causes an additional allocation for each state write, and adds some additional work to auto-unbox values when reading the value of the state. Instead, prefer to use a specialized primitive state implementation for `Int`, `Long`, `Float`, and `Double` when the state does not need to track null values and does not override the default `SnapshotMutationPolicy`."
